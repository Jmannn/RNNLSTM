# RNNLSTM
## Introduction
This is my attempt at developing a java based lstm recurrent neural network as an exercise. It was originally meant to be
a java clone, which a custom array manipulition library simply to numpy, but I found that it does not work as planned. So I plan to keep working on this by slowly adding testing, CI, and as I learn more about RNN's, a working model.

Here is the link to the program I initially tried to port into java http://wp.firrm.de/index.php/2018/04/13/building-a-lstm-network-completely-from-scratch-no-libraries/
